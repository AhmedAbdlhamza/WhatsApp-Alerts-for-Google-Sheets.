# WhatsApp-Alerts-for-Google-Sheets.
To send WhatsApp SMS alerts based on the validity dates in your Google Sheet, you will need to use a combination of Google Apps Script and a third-party API such as Twilio

Open your Google Sheet and select "Tools" -> "Script editor" to open the Google Apps Script editor.
In the editor, write a function to get the data from your Google Sheet and check the validity dates. You can use the Date() object in JavaScript to compare the dates and check if they are within 15 days of expiring.
Once you have identified the rows with validity dates that are within 15 days of expiring, use the Twilio or WhatsApp Business API to send a message to the specified WhatsApp number. You will need to set up an account with the API provider and obtain the necessary credentials and authentication tokens.
To schedule the function to run automatically at a specified interval, you can set up a time-based trigger in the Google Apps Script editor. This will allow the function to run periodically without any manual intervention.
